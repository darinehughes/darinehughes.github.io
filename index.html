### Conversational AI for training, coaching, and simulation

I design and build conversational AI systems for practice, coaching, and performance. My work lives at the intersection of dialog, assessment, and simulation, with a strong background in XR and medical training.

## What I focus on

- **Conversational training avatars**  
  Scenario driven AI characters for practice and coaching in education, customer interaction, and high stakes communication.

- **Analytics and performance feedback**  
  Rubric aligned scoring, targeted feedback, and experiment friendly data pipelines that support real learning outcomes.

- **Simulation and XR integration**  
  Years of experience connecting AI and analytics to mixed reality training, embedded sensors, and live exercises.
